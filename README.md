# ToDoList_Application

## **To-Do List Application**

This To-Do List application is a simple yet powerful tool for managing tasks. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as complete. The application uses local storage to save tasks, ensuring that they persist even after the browser is closed.

## Features:
* Add New Tasks: Users can input tasks using the text input field and add them to the list.
* Mark Tasks as Complete: Tasks can be marked as complete by checking the corresponding checkbox.
* Delete Tasks: Users can remove tasks from the list by clicking the delete icon.
* Persist Data: The application stores tasks in the browser's local storage, ensuring that tasks remain available even after refreshing the page.

## Technologies Used:
* HTML5: Structure of the application.
* CSS3: Styling, including the use of Bootstrap 4 for layout and responsiveness.
* JavaScript (ES6+): Handles task management, DOM manipulation, and interaction with local storage.
* Local Storage: Stores tasks locally on the user's device.

## How It Works
* Add Task: Enter a task in the input field and click the "Add" button. The task will be added to the task list.
* Mark Task as Complete: Check the box next to a task to mark it as complete. The task text will be crossed out.
* Delete Task: Click the trash icon next to a task to remove it from the list.
* Save Tasks: Tasks are automatically saved to local storage, ensuring persistence across sessions.

## Project Structure
* index.html: Contains the HTML structure and links to external resources (CSS, JS, Bootstrap).
* todo_css.css: Contains the custom CSS for styling the application.
* todo_javascript.js: Contains all the JavaScript logic, including task management and local storage operations.
